## Employee Salary Management System
This is the backend project of employee salary management system covering multiple user stories as per requirements. 
There are two parts of the system backend that provides consumable APIs in RESTFul way and a frontend that consumes
that API.

## Getting Started
You may need to install the following tools before you clone this repository into your development machine. 

### Prerequisites
  1. OpenJDK 18 ( https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/ )
	2. Maven ( https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi ) 
	3. NodeJS ( https://nodejs.org/en/ )
	4. Angular CLI ( https://angular.io/cli )
	5. Mysql Server ( https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ ) 
	6. Docker and Docker Compose ( https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ )

### Installation
We are using maven and spring boot and we may need to install some maven packages before any development.

1. Clone the repo
	```sh
		$ git clone https://github.com/kyarphyunaing/hremployeesalarymanagement.git
		$ cd hremployeesalarymanagement && git submodule init && git submodule update
	```
2. Install maven packages
	```sh
		$ mvn clean install
	```
3. Setup the Database
	```sh
		$ mysql -u root -p
		$ CREATE DATABASE employeedb;
	```
4. Run the spring boot app
	```sh
		$ mvn spring-boot:run
	```

Or you can go the docker way.
1. Clone the repo
	```sh
		$ git clone https://github.com/kyarphyunaing/hremployeesalarymanagement.git
		$ cd hremployeesalarymanagement && git submodule init && git submodule update
	```
2. Bring up the services by docker-compose
	```sh
		$ docker-compose up -d
	```

Then everything will be up and running as per the configuration in docker-compose. For development changes,
it is smater to do it on the host machine but if you want to update your docker containers by services here
is how it is done.

```sh
	$ docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --no-deps -d <frontend,app>
```
It take a while to recreate the docker image with updated source and deps.

## Usage
